# Security Testing Tool for Websites

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive security testing tool for websites, designed to automate vulnerability testing including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), server-side template injection (SSTI), and server-side request forgery (SSRF). It scrapes a given website, identifies forms, and tests for potential security issues. By automating these tests, the tool helps identify and address potential security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.

## Features

- **Automated Website Scraping:** The tool navigates through a given website, extracting and analyzing pages to identify forms and links.
- **Form Detection and Analysis:** Detects forms on web pages and analyzes them for potential vulnerabilities.
- **Vulnerability Testing:** Tests forms and web pages for various types of security vulnerabilities, including:
  - **SQL Injection:** Checks for the presence of SQL injection vulnerabilities in form fields.
  - **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** Evaluates form fields for potential XSS vulnerabilities by submitting a payload and checking the response.
  - **SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection):** Analyzes templates to check for potential server-side template injection vulnerabilities.
  - **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** Checks for server-side request forgery by submitting a payload and examining the response.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies for this project, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/therealslimshady0/Homewrecker.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Homewrecker
   ```

3. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python homewrecker.py -u <website_url>
   ```

   Replace `<website_url>` with the base URL of the website you want to test.

## Project Structure

- **homewrecker.py:** The main script responsible for scraping websites and testing vulnerabilities.
- **requirements.txt:** A list of Python packages required for the project.
- **README.md:** This file provides an overview and guide for the project.
- **LICENSE:** The project's licensing information.

## Security Vulnerability Testing

When testing for security vulnerabilities, the tool checks each identified form field for potential issues using automated payloads. It provides detailed output for each vulnerability detected, including:

- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The tool sends a payload to each identified form field and checks if the script tag returns in the response.
- **SSTI (Server-Side Template Injection):** The tool sends a payload to the server-side template and checks if it returns a value that suggests a potential vulnerability.
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The tool sends a payload to the server and analyzes the response to detect potential SSRF vulnerabilities.
- **SQL Injection:** The tool sends test data and examines the response to detect SQL injection issues.
